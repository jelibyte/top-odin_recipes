    <h1>Hasperat Souffle</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This souffle is a variation on the more traditional cheese souffle, using hasperat in the place of the cheese. 
      You’ll need to start a week in advance if you don’t have any hasperat on hand. 
      The hasperat is distributed evenly throughout the souffle and giving a nice flavour.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>300g / 10.5oz hasperat, drained, pressed dry and chopped into small pieces</li>
      <li>60g / 2.1oz butter at room temperature</li>
      <li>60g / 2.1oz plain flour</li>
      <li>250ml / 8.5fl oz milk</li>
      <li>Nutmeg, freshly grated</li>
      <li>Black pepper</li>
      <li>4 eggs, separated</li>
      <li>Breadcrumbs</li>
      <li>Piece each of carrot, eggplant and cucumber, for an optional garnish (use if you want your dish to look more like the one in the episode)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 200°C / 395°F.</li>
      <li>Make a bechamel sauce by melting the butter in a small saucepan and adding the flour all in one go. 
        Stir rapidly until the flour is combined from the butter and pulls away from the edges of the saucepan.
      </li>
      <li>Lower the heat and add the milk. Stir continuously until the sauce thickens (2 or 3 minutes only) to ensure there are no lumps. 
        Add the drained, chopped hasperat, stir to combine and then remove from the heat. 
        Add nutmeg and pepper to taste (no salt is needed because of the saltiness of the hasperat).
      </li>
      <li>Separate the eggs into 2 bowls.Temper the yolks by adding a spoonful or two of the cabbage mixture into the yolks and stir in. 
        This will help heat up the yolks so they don’t cook when you add them to the cabbage mixture.
      </li>
      <li>Add the yolks to the cabbage mixture and stir well. W
        hip the egg whites to stiff peaks and fold gently into the cabbage mixture, until no large lumps of egg white are left.
      </li>
      <li>Prepare your souffle dish(es) by buttering them and placing about a teaspoon of breadcrumbs in the bottom of each one 
        (or 1-2 tablespoons of breadcrumbs in a large dish). Tap the dish to distribute the breadcrumbs on the bottom and sides of the dish.
      </li>
      <li>Pour the souffle mixture into your prepared dish(es) and bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes, until the souffle is well risen and brown on the top. 
        Garnish if desired with a piece of carrot, eggplant and cucumber. Serve immediately to anyone you’re willing to help break out of prison.
      </li>
    </ol>
